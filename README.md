# ProjectOne

## Description
The product of the project allows a small company to manage the expense reimbursement requests that its employees submit. It allows employees to log into the application, fill out a request form, and submit it. It allows a manager to log into the application, view all the submitted requests, and act on the submitted requests. A manager either approves or rejects a particular request, and at the same, he/she can leave a comment regarding the action he/she has taken. The application also gives a manager a brief view on statics of the expense as well.<br>
